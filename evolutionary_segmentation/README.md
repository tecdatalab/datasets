# Evolutionary Segmentation

## Ideal Segmentation Classifier
This directory contains the data we used to train a classifier that can assess whether or not a segmentation candidate for an Electron Microscopy Map is close to the ground truth.
We define the ground truth by selecting maps that have matching PDB structures and structurally making each PDB chain to the voxels in the map. One segment in the ground truth
matches one PDB chain.
